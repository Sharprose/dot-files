@borgstrom dot-files
====================
These are my dot-files. I check them out and symlink them into place.

I tried ZSH & Prezto (`my fork of prezto`) but since it means I have to install
ZSH on every server I work on to get a consistent shell experience, I went back
to bash 'cause it's everywhere and I didn't find zsh that much better an
experience in the shell.

Solarized Terminal w/Monaco 13pt
--------------------------------
`Solarized Dark - Monaco 13.terminal` is my customized version of the OS X
`solarized terminal`_ files by Tomislav Filipčić. The only change is that the
font size has been set to 13pt from 11pt because I have a huge monitor and
don't want to squint when I work in the terminal.
